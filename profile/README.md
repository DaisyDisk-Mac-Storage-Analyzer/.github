## What is DaisyDisk?

DaisyDisk is a professional disk space analysis tool designed for macOS. It helps you understand exactly what is filling up your hard drive by presenting your files and folders as a colorful, interactive map. This visual approach makes it incredibly easy to spot the largest space consumers at a glance.

Go beyond simple file lists. DaisyDisk scans your storage with remarkable speed and builds a detailed sunburst map where each segment represents a file or folder. The larger the segment, the more space it occupies. You can hover over any segment to see its details and click to drill down into subfolders, allowing for precise navigation through your data.

The application is built with performance and security in mind. It runs natively on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, providing a smooth and responsive experience even when analyzing drives with millions of files. DaisyDisk respects your privacy – all analysis is performed locally on your Mac, and no personal data is ever sent to external servers.

Whether you are a professional dealing with limited SSD space or a casual user trying to clean up an old hard drive, DaisyDisk offers a powerful, intuitive, and safe solution for managing your disk space effectively.
